  "description": "In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site. ## Dependencies * axios * body-parser * cheerio * express * express-handlebars * mongoose * morgan ## Installation ### Install Locally ``` git clone https://github.com/maddiedeming/mongo-scraper.git cd mongo-scraper/ npm install ``` ### Commands #### Terminal 1 `mongod` #### Terminal 2 `mongo` #### Terminal 3 `node server.js` ## Requirements ### Create an app that accomplishes the following: - [x] Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to your application database.  - [x] At a minimum, the app should scrape and display the following information for each article:   - [x] Headline - the title of the article   - [x] Summary - a short summary of the article   - [x] URL - the url to the original article   - [x] Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on). - [x] Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later:   - [x] The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles   - [x] Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles   - [x] All stored comments should be visible to every user",
